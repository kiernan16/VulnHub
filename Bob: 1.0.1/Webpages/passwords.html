  Really who made this file at least get a hash of your password to display,
  hackers can't do anything with a hash, this is probably why we had a security
  breach in the first place. Comeon
  people this is basic 101 security! I have moved the file off the server. Don't make me have to clean up the mess everytime
  someone does something as stupid as this. We will have a meeting about this and other
  stuff I found on the server. >:(
